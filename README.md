Experimental validation datasets, scripts, and figures for **Section 4 (Experimental Validation)** of the manuscript

> **“Quantum Field Theory of Time (QFTT), the Weak Entanglement Symmetry Hypothesis (WESH) and Emergent Spacetime” — L. Casagrande (2025, in preparation).**

The manuscript introduces a **Quantum Field Theory of Time** where time is promoted to a local quantum field operator `T(x)`. Physical time does not pre‑exist but is generated by **Eigentime events** occurring at an intensity `Γ[ρ] > 0`, with

`dt/ds = Γ[ρ(s)]`,

so that the observable time `t` emerges from the dynamics of the state `ρ`.

A **Weak Entanglement Symmetry Hypothesis (WESH)** is imposed at the level of completely positive, trace‑preserving (CPTP) maps. A generator–level Noether constraint (WESH–Noether) selects a covariant GKSL structure with

- a **quadratic local dissipator** `D[T^2(x)]`,
- a **bilocal channel** `L_xy = T^2(x) − T^2(y)` gated by a Rényi‑2 entanglement functional and a causal kernel `K_ξ(σ)`,

and defines an emergent time–sector metric

`g^(T)_μν = α^{-1} ⟨ ∂_μ T ∂_ν T ⟩`.

At the stationary WESH bootstrap fixed point the time field aligns with the gravitational potential, `∂_μ T ∝ ∂_μ Φ`, yielding **Einstein–Hilbert gravity with O(1/N) corrections** and reproducing **black–hole thermodynamics**

`S_BH = A/(4 L_P^2) + γ log(A/L_P^2) + …`

from the same dynamics, without additional thermal ansätze or fine tuning.

## Highlights (Section 3)

This repository focuses exclusively on the **falsifiable signatures** discussed in Section 4 of the manuscript. In particular, the data and scripts here provide the basis for the following reported trends:

- **Collective stability:** coherence time scaling

  `τ_coh ∝ N^2`

  under inverse bilocal couplings, in contrast with standard decoherence where `τ_coh` remains approximately flat or decreases with `N`.

- **Angular law:** an entanglement‑dependent **cos²θ angular dependence** of the effective decay rate,

  `Γ(θ) ∝ 1 + ε cos²θ`,

  with **W‑state anti‑dependence** (`ε < 0`) indicating state‑dependent behaviour.

- **Hardware protection gap:** multipartite GHZ states show a persistent parity advantage corresponding to an **effective decoherence rate ≈ 2.6× smaller** than matched separable controls, within the analysis choices documented in the scripts.

The emphasis is on **reproducible evidence and detailed analysis choices** rather than on definitive confirmation: all fitting windows, bootstrap parameters and model assumptions are encoded in the code and can be varied by the reader.

## Scope of this repository (Section 3 only)

This repository does **not** contain the full formal development of QFTT–WESH.  
It provides the **numerical and experimental material** underpinning Section 4 (Experimental Validation):

- Classical simulations (pre‑asymptotic collision model, `N = 2 … 16`) yield an effective scaling

  `γ(N) ∝ N^{-1.804}`

  with tight confidence intervals, **consistent with** an approach towards the predicted `N^{-2}` behaviour within the accessible pre‑asymptotic regime.

- Experiments on **IBM Eagle** (127‑qubit superconducting device) and **Rigetti Ankaa‑3** (82‑qubit) — totaling over `3×10^6` hardware shots — display:
  - a clear `cos²θ` **angular dependence** of the decay rate,
  - a robust GHZ vs PRODUCT protection gap,
  - control tests (Fake‑GHZ, W‑state) that substantially constrain gate‑overhead and classical‑noise explanations.

## Repository layout

All material lives under [`experiments/`](experiments/).  
Each subfolder corresponds **one‑to‑one** to a figure in Section 4 and contains:

- Python scripts for simulations and analysis,
- raw and processed numerical data (CSV / JSON / logs),
- the final figure(s) used in the paper.

| Folder        | Manuscript figure(s) | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `3.1/`        | Fig. 3.1             | WESH vs standard local decoherence (purity & coherence scaling, CPU simulations). |
| `3.2/`        | Fig. 3.2             | Coherence under dephasing / projective / amplitude damping with different `N`‑scaling of the coupling. |
| `3.3-3.4/`    | Figs. 3.3–3.4        | Pre‑asymptotic collision model vs first‑order local model: `γ(N)` scaling (`α ≈ −1.80` vs `−1`). |
| `3.5/`        | Fig. 3.5             | IBM Eagle QPU: `cos²θ` angular dependence (`N = 3`), mini‑scaling at `θ ≈ 30°`, and W‑state control. |
| `3.6/`        | Fig. 3.6             | Fake‑GHZ control: gate‑matched PRODUCT / FAKE_GHZ / GHZ sequences to separate gate overhead from genuine entanglement effects. |
| `3.7-3.8/`    | Figs. 3.7–3.8        | GHZ vs PRODUCT parity distributions and decay statistics (IBM Eagle Experiment 6): ECDFs, violin plots, significance analysis (≈ `21σ`). |
| `3.9/`        | Fig. 3.9             | Cross‑platform countercheck on Rigetti Ankaa‑3: `cos²θ` angular dependence for `N = 3 … 6`, 400k shots. |

Each folder is self‑contained: running the main script in that directory regenerates the corresponding plots from the included data (subject to the required Python/QPU dependencies).

## Quick start (reproducibility)

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired figure folder, e.g. `experiments/3.5/`.
3. Ensure Python 3.x and the required libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, plus `qiskit` / `qiskit-ibm-runtime` or `braket` where relevant) are installed.
4. Run the main analysis script to regenerate the plots from the provided data.

Hardware access (IBM Quantum, AWS Braket) is *not* required for reproducing the figures: all QPU results are available as CSV/JSON files.
