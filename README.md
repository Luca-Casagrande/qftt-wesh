> **“Quantum Field Theory of Time (QFTT), the Weak Entanglement Symmetry Hypothesis (WESH) and Emergent Spacetime” — L. Casagrande (2025, in preparation).**

The manuscript introduces a **Quantum Field Theory of Time** where time is promoted to a local quantum field operator \(\hat T(x)\). Physical time does not pre-exist but is generated by **Eigentime events** occurring at an intensity \(\Gamma[\rho] > 0\), with
\[
\frac{dt}{ds} = \Gamma[\rho(s)] ,
\]
so that the observable time \(t\) emerges from the dynamics of the state \(\rho\).

A **Weak Entanglement Symmetry Hypothesis (WESH)** is imposed at the level of completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) maps. A generator–level Noether constraint (WESH–Noether) fixes a unique covariant GKSL structure with

- a **quadratic local dissipator** \(\mathcal D[\hat T^2(x)]\),
- a **bilocal channel** \(L_{xy} = \hat T^2(x) - \hat T^2(y)\) gated by a Rényi‑2 entanglement functional and a causal kernel \(K_\xi(\sigma)\),

and defines an emergent time–sector metric
\[
g^{(T)}_{\mu\nu} = \alpha^{-1} \langle \partial_\mu \hat T\,\partial_\nu \hat T \rangle .
\]

At the unique fixed point of the WESH bootstrap the time field aligns with the gravitational potential, \(\partial_\mu \hat T \propto \partial_\mu \Phi\), yielding **Einstein–Hilbert gravity with \(\mathcal O(1/N)\) corrections** and reproducing **black–hole thermodynamics**
\[
S_{\rm BH} = \frac{A}{4 L_P^2} + \gamma \ln\!\frac{A}{L_P^2} + \cdots
\]
directly from the same dynamics, without thermal ansätze or fine tuning.

## Scope of this repository (Section 4 only)

This repository does **not** contain the full formal development of QFTT–WESH.  
It provides the **numerical and experimental evidence** for the theory’s falsifiable signatures, as presented in **Section 4 (Experimental Validation)**:

- **Collective stability:** coherence time scaling
  \[
  \tau_{\mathrm{coh}} \propto N^{2}
  \]
  under inverse bilocal couplings, vs.\ standard decoherence with \(\tau_{\mathrm{coh}}\) flat or decreasing in \(N\).

- **Angular law:** a robust entanglement‑dependent modulation
  \[
  \Gamma(\theta) \propto 1 + \varepsilon \cos^{2}\theta ,
  \]
  with **W‑state anti‑modulation** (\(\varepsilon < 0\)).

- **Hardware protection gap:** multipartite GHZ entanglement exhibits a parity advantage corresponding to **\(\sim 2.6\times\)** slower effective decoherence than matched separable controls.

The data and scripts here show that:

- Classical simulations (pre‑asymptotic collision model, \(N=2\ldots 16\)) yield
  \(\gamma(N) \propto N^{-1.804}\) with tight confidence intervals, trending towards the predicted \(N^{-2}\) law.
- Experiments on **IBM Eagle** (127‑qubit superconducting device) and **Rigetti Ankaa‑3** (82‑qubit) — totaling over **3×10⁶ hardware shots** — exhibit:
  - clear \(\cos^{2}\theta\) angular dependence,
  - a persistent GHZ vs PRODUCT protection gap,
  - control tests (Fake‑GHZ, W‑state) excluding trivial gate‑overhead or classical artifacts.

## Repository layout

All material lives under [`experiments/`](experiments/).  
Each subfolder corresponds **one‑to‑one** to a figure in Section 4 of the manuscript and contains:

- Python scripts for simulations and analysis,
- raw and processed numerical data (CSV / JSON / logs),
- the final figure(s) used in the paper.

| Folder        | Manuscript figure(s) | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `4.1/`        | Fig. 4.1             | WESH vs standard local decoherence (purity & coherence scaling, CPU simulations). |
| `4.2/`        | Fig. 4.2             | Coherence under dephasing / projective / amplitude damping with different \(N\)‑scaling of the coupling. |
| `4.3-4.4/`    | Figs. 4.3–4.4        | Pre‑asymptotic collision model vs first‑order local model: \(\gamma(N)\) scaling (\(\alpha \approx -1.80\) vs \(-1\)). |
| `4.5/`        | Fig. 4.5             | IBM Eagle QPU: \(\cos^{2}\theta\) angular dependence (N=3), mini‑scaling at \(\theta \approx 30^\circ\), and W‑state control. |
| `4.6/`        | Fig. 4.6             | Fake‑GHZ control: gate‑matched PRODUCT / FAKE_GHZ / GHZ sequences to disentangle gate overhead from genuine entanglement protection. |
| `4.7-4.8/`    | Figs. 4.7–4.8        | GHZ vs PRODUCT parity distributions and decay statistics (IBM Eagle Experiment 6): ECDFs, violin plots, significance analysis (\(\sim 21\sigma\)). |
| `4.9/`        | Fig. 4.9             | Cross‑platform countercheck on Rigetti Ankaa‑3: \(\cos^{2}\theta\) angular dependence for \(N=3\ldots 6\), 400k shots. |

Each folder is self‑contained: running the main script in that directory regenerates the corresponding plots from the included data (subject to the required Python/QPU dependencies).

## Reproducibility notes

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Core libraries:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, plus:
  - `qiskit`, `qiskit-ibm-runtime` for IBM Eagle experiments,
  - `braket` SDK for Rigetti Ankaa‑3 tasks.
- Hardware‑level runs depend on access credentials (IBM Quantum, AWS Braket).  
  For peer review, all raw **result CSV/JSON files** are included so that plots and statistics can be reproduced *offline* without re‑running hardware jobs.

The intention is that a referee or collaborator can:

1. Inspect the raw data directly (CSV/JSON).
2. Run the Python scripts to regenerate all Section 4 figures.
3. Verify the reported fits, confidence intervals, and significance levels.
