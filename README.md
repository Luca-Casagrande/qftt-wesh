> **"Quantum Field Theory of Time (QFTT), the Weak Entanglement Symmetry Hypothesis (WESH) and Emergent Spacetime" — L. Casagrande (2026).**

The manuscript introduces a **Quantum Field Theory of Time** where time is promoted to a local quantum field operator `T(x)`. Physical time does not pre‑exist but is generated by **Eigentime events** occurring at an intensity `Γ[ρ] > 0`, with

`dt/ds = Γ[ρ(s)]`,

so that the observable time `t` emerges from the dynamics of the state `ρ`.

A **Weak Entanglement Symmetry Hypothesis (WESH)** is imposed at the level of completely positive, trace‑preserving (CPTP) maps. A generator–level Noether constraint (WESH–Noether) selects a covariant GKSL structure with

- a **quadratic local dissipator** `D[T^2(x)]`,
- a **bilocal channel** `L_xy = T^2(x) − T^2(y)` gated by a Rényi‑2 entanglement functional and a causal kernel `K_ξ(σ)`,

and defines an emergent time–sector metric

`g^(T)_μν = α^{-1} ⟨ ∂_μ T ∂_ν T ⟩`.

At the stationary WESH bootstrap fixed point the time field aligns with the gravitational potential, `∂_μ T ∝ ∂_μ Φ`, yielding **Einstein–Hilbert gravity with O(1/N) corrections** and reproducing **black–hole thermodynamics**

`S_BH = A/(4 L_P^2) + γ log(A/L_P^2) + …`

from the same dynamics, without additional thermal ansätze or fine tuning.

## Formal Verification (Lean 4)

The core mathematical results of QFTT-WESH have been **formally verified in Lean 4** using Mathlib. All files compile and type-check.

| File | Content | Key Theorems |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `formal-verification/Section1_Appendices.lean` | Core WESH algebra + Appendices A,B,C,G,H,I | WESH-Noether, Γ≥0, eigentime activation, N² scaling, CPTP preservation |
| `formal-verification/AppendixD.lean` | Fixed point theorem | Variational alignment, `appendix_D_main_result` → Einstein equations |
| `formal-verification/Section5.lean` | Dynamical derivation of GR | `theorem_5_1_fixed_point`, `theorem_5_4_einstein_emergence` |
| `formal-verification/Section6_FIRST.lean` | Black hole entropy | Universal **1/4 prefactor** derived, `theorem_S_BH_asymptotics` |
| `formal-verification/Section6_SECOND.lean` | Holographic bound | `holographic_bound_from_chronogenesis`: Γ≥0 ⟹ S≤S_BH |
| `formal-verification/AppendixJ.lean` | Λ as shot noise | `J4_Lambda_Fluctuation_Scaling`: δΛ ~ 1/√V₄ ~ H² |

**What is formally verified:**
- Einstein field equations **derived** from WESH stationarity (the physical axioms in Lean — alignment, hidden-sector cancellation — are themselves derived in the manuscript from the WESH-Noether structure; see Appendix D)
- Bekenstein-Hawking entropy: the **1/4 prefactor** emerges without free parameters
- Cosmological constant: Λ ~ H² as **ontological shot noise** of eigentime production

The Lean formalization verifies the logical structure; the manuscript provides the complete physical derivation.

To verify locally (pinned toolchain: **Lean v4.24.0**, Mathlib commit `f897ebcf`):
```bash
cd formal-verification
lake build
```

## Experimental Validation (Section 3)

This repository also contains the **numerical and experimental material** underpinning Section 3 (Experimental Validation):

### Highlights

- **Collective stability:** coherence time scaling

  `τ_coh ∝ N^2`

  under inverse bilocal couplings, in contrast with standard decoherence where `τ_coh` remains approximately flat or decreases with `N`.

- **Angular law:** an entanglement‑dependent **cos²θ angular dependence** of the effective decay rate,

  `Γ(θ) ∝ 1 + ε cos²θ`,

  with **W‑state anti‑dependence** (`ε < 0`) indicating state‑dependent behaviour.

- **Hardware protection gap:** multipartite GHZ states show a persistent parity advantage corresponding to an **effective decoherence rate ≈ 2.6× smaller** than matched separable controls.

### Data

- Classical simulations (pre‑asymptotic collision model, `N = 2 … 16`) yield an effective scaling

  `γ(N) ∝ N^{-1.804}`

  with tight confidence intervals, **consistent with** an approach towards the predicted `N^{-2}` behaviour within the accessible pre‑asymptotic regime.

- Experiments on **IBM Eagle** (127‑qubit superconducting device) and **Rigetti Ankaa‑3** (82‑qubit) — totaling over `3×10^6` hardware shots — display:
  - a clear `cos²θ` **angular dependence** of the decay rate,
  - a robust GHZ vs PRODUCT protection gap,
  - control tests (Fake‑GHZ, W‑state) that substantially constrain gate‑overhead and classical‑noise explanations.

Each folder is self‑contained: running the main script in that directory regenerates the corresponding plots from the included data.
