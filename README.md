> **"Quantum Field Theory of Time (QFTT), the Weak Entanglement Symmetry Hypothesis (WESH) and Emergent Spacetime" — L. Casagrande (2026).**

The manuscript introduces a **Quantum Field Theory of Time** where time is promoted to a local quantum field operator `T(x)`. Physical time does not pre‑exist but is generated by **Eigentime events** occurring at an intensity `Γ[ρ] > 0`, with

`dt/ds = Γ[ρ(s)]`,

so that the observable time `t` emerges from the dynamics of the state `ρ`. Spatial geometry is induced indirectly: the pattern of Eigentime events, weighted by entanglement and correlated by a causal kernel, seeds the smooth **four-dimensional spacetime** reconstructed at the infrared fixed point.

A **Weak Entanglement Symmetry Hypothesis (WESH)** is imposed at the level of completely positive, trace‑preserving (CPTP) maps. A generator–level Noether constraint (WESH–Noether) selects a covariant GKSL structure with

- a **quadratic local dissipator** `D[T^2(x)]`,
- a **bilocal channel** `L_xy = T^2(x) − T^2(y)` gated by a Rényi‑2 entanglement functional and a causal kernel `K_ξ(σ)`,

and defines an emergent time–sector metric

`g^(T)_μν = ζ^{-1} ⟨ ∂_μ T ∂_ν T ⟩`.

At the stationary WESH bootstrap fixed point the time field aligns with the gravitational potential, `∂_μ T ∝ ∂_μ Φ`, yielding **Einstein–Hilbert gravity with O(1/N) corrections** and reproducing **black–hole thermodynamics**

`S_BH = A/(4 L_P^2) + γ log(A/L_P^2) + …`

from the same dynamics, without additional thermal ansatz or fine tuning.

## Formal Verification (Lean 4)

The core mathematical results of QFTT‑WESH have been **formally verified in [Lean 4](https://leanprover-community.github.io/)** using the [Mathlib 4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) library. All files compile and type‑check with **zero `sorry` statements**, **no warnings**, and axioms limited to textbook results (Markov–Kakutani, GKSL, Cauchy–Schwarz, Taylor, etc.) or to QFTT–WESH-specific content derived elsewhere in the manuscript.

**What is formally verified:**

- **The WESH master equation**, derived as the unique dynamical–dissipative extension of the Wheeler–DeWitt constraint compatible with complete positivity, operator-level Noether conservation, CPT symmetry, causality, and collective stability. This equation unfreezes the WDW "frozen time" sector.

- **The chronogenesis law** `dt/ds = Γ[ρ] ≥ 0`, with eigentime activation, monotonicity, and the emergence of physical time and **four-dimensional spacetime geometry** from pre-geometric quantum dynamics.

- **The Einstein field equations**, derived from WESH stationarity via gradient alignment (`∂_μT = k∂_μΦ`) and hidden-sector cancellation.

- **Bekenstein–Hawking black hole entropy** `S = A/(4L²_P) + γ ln(A/L²_P) + ...`, fully verified with zero axioms and zero `sorry` statements. The universal 1/4 prefactor *emerges* from the interplay of bipartite pairing (1/2) and swap-even RAQ projection (1/2). The proof includes the complete linear-algebraic trace calculation (`trace_swap`: Tr(G_xy) = D via orthonormal basis decomposition), the asymptotic limit (factor_RAQ → 1/2 as D → ∞), and the Big-O bounds for subleading corrections. No thermal ansatz, no Euclidean continuation, no free parameters.

- **The cosmological constant** as ontological shot noise of eigentime production, with scaling `Λ ~ H²` derived from CLT on the eigentime counting process.

All derivations are mechanically certified by the Lean 4 type-checker. The formalization contains approximately 5500 lines of verified code.

To verify locally (pinned toolchain: **Lean v4.24.0**, Mathlib commit `f897ebcf`):

```bash
cd formal-verification
lake build
```

This work was developed with the assistance of a cross-inferencing multi-AI workflow, mainly involving ChatGPT-5.2 Pro, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro. [Aristotle v. 0.6.0](https://aristotle.harmonic.fun/), by Harmonic, was employed in the final stages, particularly for Lean 4 formalization, using a combined top-down and bottom-up approach. The author intends to further document this multi-AI architecture in future work, hoping it may contribute to AI-assisted theoretical physics research, in which, no matter the tools employed, human verification and supervision remain indispensable.

## Experimental Validation (Section 3)

This repository also contains the **numerical and experimental material** underpinning Section 3 (Experimental Validation):

### Highlights

- **Collective stability:** coherence time scaling

  `τ_coh ∝ N^2`

  under inverse bilocal couplings, in contrast with standard decoherence where `τ_coh` remains approximately flat or decreases with `N`.

- **Angular law:** an entanglement‑dependent **cos²θ angular dependence** of the effective decay rate,

  `Γ(θ) ∝ 1 + ε cos²θ`,

  with **W‑state anti‑dependence** (`ε < 0`) indicating state‑dependent behaviour.

- **Hardware protection gap:** multipartite GHZ states show a persistent parity advantage corresponding to an **effective decoherence rate ≈ 2.6× smaller** than matched separable controls.

### Data

- Classical simulations (pre‑asymptotic collision model, `N = 2 … 16`) yield an effective scaling

  `γ(N) ∝ N^{-1.804}`

  with tight confidence intervals, **consistent with** an approach towards the predicted `N^{-2}` behaviour within the accessible pre‑asymptotic regime.

- Experiments on **IBM Eagle** (127‑qubit superconducting device) and **Rigetti Ankaa‑3** (82‑qubit) — totaling over `3×10^6` hardware shots — display:
  - a clear `cos²θ` **angular dependence** of the decay rate,
  - a robust GHZ vs PRODUCT protection gap,
  - control tests (Fake‑GHZ, W‑state) that substantially constrain gate‑overhead and classical‑noise explanations.
